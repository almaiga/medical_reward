2,"{
  ""answer"": ""INCORRECT"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Pseudohyponatremia is characterized by a falsely low serum sodium level, not a normal or high one; a sodium level of 134 mEq/L is within the normal range and does not support the diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia.""

  ""answer"": ""INCORRECT"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Dural compression is not a diagnosis or finding associated with a soft tissue mass; dural compression is a neurological finding and should not be described as having a 'soft tissue mass' in this context.""

6,"{

  ""answer"": ""INCORRECT"",

  ""answer"": ""INCORRECT"",
  ""reasoning"": ""The note states that the mass is consistent with an abscess but concludes it is likely a hematoma with low suspicion for infection, which is medically inconsistent because a hematoma is not typically associated with the signs or symptoms of infection, and the imaging findings of mixed echogenicity and hypoechoic mass in a neutropenic patient with fever should raise concern for abscess rather than hematoma.""
